#: src/background.md:33
msgid ""
"_Active recall testing_ means being asked a question and trying to remember "
"the answer. This is in contrast to _passive study_, where we read, watch, or "
"listen to something without pausing to consider if we know the answer. "
"Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at "
"building strong memories than passive study. There are two reasons for this:"
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:40
msgid ""
"The act of recalling something _strengthens_ the memory, increasing the "
"chances we’ll be able to remember it again."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:43
msgid ""
"When we're unable to answer a question, it tells us we need to return to the "
"material to review or relearn it."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:46
msgid ""
"You have probably encountered active recall testing in your school years "
"without even realizing it. When good teachers give you a series of questions "
"to answer after reading an article, or make you take weekly tests, they are "
"not doing it simply to see if you understood the material or not. By testing "
"you, they are increasing the chances you will be able to remember the "
"material in the future."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:53
msgid ""
"A good way to integrate active recall testing into your own studies is to "
"use _flashcards_. With traditional paper flashcards, you write a question on "
"one side of a card, and the answer on the other side. By not turning the "
"card over until you've recalled the answer, you can learn things more "
"effectively than passive observation allows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use It or Lose It"

#: src/background.md:61
msgid ""
"Our brains are efficient machines, and they rapidly forget information that "
"doesn't seem useful. Chances are that you don't remember what you had for "
"dinner on Monday two weeks ago, because this information is not usually "
"useful. However, if you went to a fantastic restaurant that day and have "
"spent the last two weeks telling people about how great it was, you're "
"likely to still remember it in vivid detail."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:68
msgid ""
"The brain's \"use it or lose it\" policy applies to everything we learn. If "
"you spend an afternoon memorizing some science terms, and then don't think "
"about that material for two weeks, you'll probably have forgotten most of "
"it. In fact, studies show we forget about 75% of material learned within a "
"48 hour period. This can seem pretty depressing when you need to learn a lot "
"of information!"
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:75
msgid ""
"However, the solution is simple: _review_. By reviewing newly-learned "
"information, we can greatly reduce forgetting."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:78
msgid ""
"The only problem is that traditionally, reviewing has not been very "
"practical. If you are using paper flashcards, it's easy to flick through all "
"of them if you only have 30 of them to review, but as the number grows to "
"300 or 3000, it quickly becomes unmanageable."

msgid "Spaced Repetition"
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:85
msgid ""
"The _spacing effect_ was reported in 1885 by a German psychologist called "
"Hermann Ebbinghaus. He observed that we tend to remember things more "
"effectively, if we spread reviews out over time, instead of studying "
"multiple times in one session. Since the 1930s, there have been a number of "
"proposals for utilizing the spacing effect to improve learning, in what has "
"come to be called _spaced repetition_."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:92
msgid ""
"One example was in 1972, when a German scientist called Sebastian Leitner "
"popularized a method of spaced repetition with paper flashcards. By "
"separating the paper cards into a series of boxes, and moving the cards to a "
"different box on each successful or unsuccessful review, it was possible to "
"see at a glance a rough estimate of how well a card was known and when it "
"should be reviewed again. This was a great improvement over a single box of "
"cards, and it has been widely adopted by computerized flashcard software. It "
"is a rather rough approach however, as it cannot give you an exact date on "
"which you should review something again, and it does not work very well with "
"material of varying difficulty."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:104
msgid ""
"The biggest developments in the last 30 years have come from the authors of "
"SuperMemo, a commercial flashcard program that implements spaced repetition. "
"SuperMemo pioneered the concept of a system that keeps track of the ideal "
"time to review material and optimizes itself based on the performance of the "
"user."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:110
msgid ""
"In SuperMemo's spaced repetition system, every time you answer a question, "
"you tell the program how well you were able to remember it — whether you "
"forgot completely, made a small mistake, remembered with trouble, remembered "
"easily, etc. The program uses this feedback to decide the optimal time to "
"show you the question again. Because a memory gets stronger each time you "
"successfully recall it, the time between reviews gets longer and longer — so "
"you may see a question for the first time today, then 3 days later, 15 days "
"later, 45 days later, and so on."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:119
msgid ""
"This was a revolution in learning, as it meant material could be learned and "
"retained with the absolute minimum amount of effort necessary. SuperMemo's "
"slogan sums it up: with spaced repetition, you can: \"forget about "
"forgetting\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why Anki?"
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:126
msgid ""
"While there is no denying the huge impact SuperMemo has had on the field, it "
"is not without its problems. The program is often criticized for being buggy "
"and difficult to navigate. It only runs on Windows computers. It is "
"proprietary software, meaning that end-users cannot extend it or access the "
"raw data. And while very old versions have been made available for free, "
"they are quite limited for modern use."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:133
msgid ""
"Anki addresses these issues. There are free clients for Anki available on "
"many platforms, so struggling students and teachers with budgetary "
"constraints are not left out. Anki is open source, with an already "
"flourishing library of add-ons contributed by end-users. It is "
"multi-platform, running on Windows, macOS, Linux/FreeBSD, and some mobile "
"devices. And it is considerably easier to use than SuperMemo."
msgstr ""

#: src/background.md:140
msgid ""
"Anki's spaced repetition system is based on an older version of the "
"SuperMemo algorithm called "
"[SM-2](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm). Recently, "
